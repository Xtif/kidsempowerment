				<p>
					For the period 2016-2020, the organization considers that the situation of children on the move and youth migrants is a serious issue in Europe and elsewhere. The fundamental rights and principles of children, as established under international law, are often not respected. Lack of information, awareness and agency leads to further discrimination and neglect. The respect of basic principles established under international law is vital for the development of children into responsible, engaged and accomplished citizens. It is essential that all measures be taken to enable their full development and potential and to facilitate their integration in their new country. All programs for that period will address the rights of migrant children worldwide.
